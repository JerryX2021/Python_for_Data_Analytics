# The Covid-19 cases seem to be age dependent.
# The '0-39' age groups have relatively higher infection rates. This could be a result of more solcial activities such as going to work, attending school, entertainment acitivies, etc.
# The '40-79' age group have relatively lower infection rates, with infection rate decline with age. Maybe they practise Covid safety measures better? Interesting observation!
# The'80-89' and especially the '90+' age groups see a surge of infection rates. There were reports on Covid outbreaks at aged care facilities. Urgent improvements are needed to protect the vulnerable members of the community!
# The Australian Department of Health publishes Covid outbreaks at Aged Care Facilities. https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/covid-19-outbreaks-in-australian-residential-aged-care-facilities

# The Vaccination againest Covid-19 is underway in Australia. It would be interesting to know how vaccination affects Covid infections and how each age group respond to the vaccination program.
# Watch out for the next project!
