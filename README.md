# Python for data analytics

Data analytics using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook. 

In this notebook, I explore the skills of data analytics using Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to read, inspect, clean, manipulate, visualise and report data.

At the time of writing this notebook (end of 2021), we are still in the jungle of a global pandemic. Covid-19 has fundamentally changed the way people work, live, and socialize. It has sadly taken millions of lives and affected people's livelihood tremendously. :earth_asia: In Australia, people's lives :heart:, health :mask:, mental fitness :disappointed:, jobs :computer: have been impacted by lengthy lockdowns, outbreaks and border closure. Victoria, a southern state in Australia with a population of over 6 million, is one of the hardest hit place by Covid-19. :broken_heart:

In this project, I perform data analytics of the Victorian Covid-19 data to understand how Covid-19 has affected the Victorian community and what insights/improvements can be informed. Hopefully, this can shed light on our understanding of contagious diseases and better prepare the community for future health challenges. Together, we can reach the other side of the tunnel! :sun_with_face:

I credit to the Victorian Department of Health and the  Australian bureau of statistics for providing freely accessible data utilized in this project. :clap:
